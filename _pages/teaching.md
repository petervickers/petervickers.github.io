## Teaching Experience

During my Ph.D, I am a Graduate Teaching Assistant for the following modules at the University of Sheffield in the following modules:


- **Theoretical Foundations for Computing Systems (COM2109)**
- **Text Processing (COM3110/4115)**
- **Natural Language Processing (COM6513)**

My work consisted of attending the labs where students implimented concepts taught in the course lectures. My assistance ranged from mathematical questions on underlying theory to practical coding implimentations of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing models. I marked coursework scripts for Natrual Language processing.
