I am a Computer Scientist with specialisation in Natural Language Processing and Multimodal AI. Currently, I am in the final year of my Ph.D. at The University of Sheffield, where my research focuses on augmenting language models with multimodal information. My advisor is [Nikos Aletras](https://nikosaletras.com/), and previously [Lo√Øc Barrault](https://loicbarrault.github.io/). My PhD is dual-funded by the [UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Speech and Language Technologies](https://slt-cdt.sheffield.ac.uk/) and an [Amazon Studentship Grant](https://www.amazon.jobs/en-gb/business_categories/student-programs).

My work is enhancing models' capabilities through multimodal data for tasks including [Visual Question Answering](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-short.60/), Text-to-Image Retrieval, and Citation Recommendation. I am also interested in [better metrics](https://aclanthology.org/2023.ijcnlp-main.33/) for these tasks.

During my PhD, I joined the JSALT summer workshop twice:  [Multi-lingual Speech to Speech Translation for Under-Resourced Languages](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/speech-translation-for-under-resourced-languages/) in Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, USA (2022) and [Better Together: Text + Context](https://jsalt2023.univ-lemans.fr/en/better-together-text-context.html) in Le Mans, France (2023). At Amazon UK I interned as an Applied Scientist where I adapted Vision-Language models for Text-Image Retrieval (2022-2023).

Before my Ph.D, I had an MSc in [Computer Science with Speech and NLP](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/courses/2024/computer-science-speech-and-language-processing-msc) from the University of Sheffield, and a BA in [English Language and Literature](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/courses/course-listing/english-language-and-literature) from Magdalen College, Oxford.

In my free time I enjoy backcountry ski tours: the Hardangervidda and Jotunheimen areas of Norway are my favourite. In 2022 I took part in a two-week trip to the High Arctic in Trollheimen, Svalbard where I learned to build igloos. After submitting my thesis, I will lead the five week 2024 UK [Stauning Alps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stauning_Alps) expedition to Eastern Greenland.
